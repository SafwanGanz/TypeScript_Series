# TypeScript Learning Series

This comprehensive series is designed to take you from a beginner to an advanced user of TypeScript, enabling you to build robust and maintainable applications. Whether you are a JavaScript developer looking to enhance your skills or a newcomer to programming, this series provides clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on projects to solidify your understanding.

## Q: What are the differences between TypeScript and JavaScript?

**A:**

- **TypeScript:** Allows for optional static typing. This means you can define types for variables, function parameters, and return values, which are checked at compile-time.
  
- **JavaScript:** Is dynamically typed, meaning types are determined at runtime, and thereâ€™s no type-checking during development.

### Example

> **TypeScript**

```bash
let age: number = 30;
````
> **JavaScript**

```bash
let age = 30; // Type is inferred at runtime
```

*data structures can be represented in various ways.*


**1. Arrays**

*Arrays are used to store a collection of elements*

```bash
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let names: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
```

**2. Tuples**

*Tuples allow storing multiple types in a fixed-size array*

```bash
let person: [string, number];
person = ["Alice", 25];
```

**3. Enums**

*Enums are used to define a set of named constants*

```bash
enum Direction {
    North,
    South,
    East,
    West,
}

let dir: Direction = Direction.North;
```
