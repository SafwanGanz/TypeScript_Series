## Q: What are the differences between TypeScript and JavaScript?

**A:**

- **TypeScript:** Allows for optional static typing. This means you can define types for variables, function parameters, and return values, which are checked at compile-time.
  
- **JavaScript:** Is dynamically typed, meaning types are determined at runtime, and thereâ€™s no type-checking during development.

### Example

> **TypeScript**

```bash
let age: number = 30;
````
> **JavaScript**

```bash
let age = 30; // Type is inferred at runtime
```
